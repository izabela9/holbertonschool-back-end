Bash Scripting Limitations

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks, but it may not be suitable for certain scenarios. Avoid using Bash for:

Complex Data Processing
Cross-Platform Compatibility
GUI Development
What is an API?

An API is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.

What is a REST API?

REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a widely used architectural style for designing networked applications. It leverages standard HTTP methods and typically returns data in JSON format.

Microservices

Microservices is an architectural style where a software application is composed of small, independent services that communicate through well-defined APIs. This promotes scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

Data Formats

CSV Format
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a simple file format for storing tabular data. Rows are represented by lines, and columns are separated by commas.

JSON Format
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is easy for both humans to read and machines to parse. JSON represents data as key-value pairs and supports nested structures.

Pythonic Naming Conventions

Package and Module Name Style: lowercase_with_underscores
Class Name Style: CamelCase
Variable Name Style: lowercase_with_underscores
Function Name Style: lowercase_with_underscores
Constant Name Style: UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords or CamelCase is a naming convention commonly used for class names in Python. This convention enhances code readability and aligns with the PEP 8 style guide.
